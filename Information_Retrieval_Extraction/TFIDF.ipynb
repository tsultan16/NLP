    "#### TFIDF Passage Retrieval\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple and efficient way of retreiving relevant documents (e.g. sentence or paragraph) from a document store is using `TFIDF`. Given a collection of documents, we can create TFIDF vectors for each document, which is a vector of TFIDF weights (one for each word from the vocabulary). \n",
    "\n",
    "Term-frequency for term $t$ in document $d$: \n",
    "\n",
    "$TF(t,d) = 1 + \\log_{10}(\\text{count}(t,d))$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\text{count}(t,d)$ is the frequency with which term $t$ appears in document $d$. (Note that we take the log to supress the range of count values).\n",
    "\n",
    "`BM25`: By making a slight modification to how the term frequency is computer, we can improve performance. Note that the log counts can grow to large values if certain terms are extremely common, (i.e. unbounded growth). Instead of using the log function, we can use a different function which puts an upper bound on the TF value so that growth saturates when the raw counts keep increasing beyond a certain point. This modification to TF is called `BM25` and is given by the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "$TF_{BM25}(t,d) = \\frac{(1+k)  \\text{ count}(t,d)}{\\text{count}(t,d) + k \\text{ } (1 - b + b \\frac{|d|}{d_{avg}})}$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $|d|$ is the length of the document and $d_{avg}$ is the average document length across the entire collection. $k$ is a hyperparameter which controls how quickly the TF value starts saturating and $b$ is a hyperparameter which penalizes documents which are longer than the average document length.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Inverse-document-frequency for term $t$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$IDF(t) = \\log_{10}(\\frac{N}{\\text{df}(t)})$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $N$ is the total number of documents in the collectino and $\\text{df}(t)$ is the number of documents in which term $t$ occurs. Then the TFIDF is given by the following product:\n",
    "\n",
    "$TFIDF(t,d) = TF(t,d) IDF(t)$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Then given a query $q$ which is a sequence of terms, we can construct a TFIDF vector for this query. However, since queries are usually short and is likely to contain a single occurance of each unique term, we can simplify it's TFIDF vector by setting the TFIDF weight for each unique term to 1. Then we can compute a score for each document as the cosine similarity between the query vector and the corresponding document TFIDF vector $d$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$score(q,d) = \\frac{q \\cdot d}{|q| |d|}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since $|q|$ is a fixed constant, we can ignore it because it will not affect the ranking of document scores. Then using our simplifying assumption of $q$ being a vector of binary weights, we have the following document score function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$score(q,d) = \\frac{\\sum_{t\\in q} TFIDF(t,d)}{\\sqrt{\\sum_{t\\in d} TFIDF(t,d)^2}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the square root term in the denominator is the norm of the document TFIDF vector. So the score for each document is just the TFIDF weights for the query terms which also appear in that document, normalized by the norm of that documents TFIDF vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now each word in the query will not occur in all documents, so we need to only consider documents that actually contain these query words instead of iterating over all documents in the collection. We can maintain an `inverted index` data structure which is a dictionary that maps each unique word to a list of tuples, each tuple containing a document and the TFIDF weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "e.g. `inverted_index = {'w1' : [(d1, TFIDF(w1,d1)), (d2, TFIDF(w1,d2),..)], 'w2': ...}`\n",
    "\n",
    "This data structure will allow us to compute and rank the document scores very efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "This simple information retrieval algorithm works well in most situation. However, note that this algorithm will only work if there is an exact match between a subset of words from the query and the relevant documents, otherwise the cosine similarity between the query and document TFIDF vector will be zero. For this types of situations, it is better to use some kind of dense vector representation for documents and queries which don't rely on raw word counts. "

Born and raised in Houston, Texas, she performed in various singing and dancing competitions as a child, and rose to fame in the late 1990s as lead singer of R&B girl-group Destiny\\'s Child. Managed by her father, Mathew Knowles, the group became one of the world\\'s best-selling girl groups of all time. Their hiatus saw the release of Beyoncé\\'s debut album, Dangerously in Love (2003), which established her as a solo artist worldwide, earned five Grammy Awards and featured the Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles \"Crazy in Love\" and \"Baby Boy\".'}"

      "QUERY:  In what year was the iPod first introduced?, GOLD DOCUMENT: IPod: Though the iPod was released in 2001, its price and Mac-only compatibility caused sales to be relatively slow until 2004. The iPod line came from Apple's \"digital hub\" category, when the company began creating software for the growing market of personal digital devices. Digital cameras, camcorders and organizers had well-established mainstream markets, but the company found existing digital music players \"big and clunky or small and useless\" with user interfaces that were \"unbelievably awful,\" so Apple decided to develop its own. As ordered by CEO Steve Jobs, Apple's hardware engineering chief Jon Rubinstein assembled a team of engineers to design the iPod line, including hardware engineers Tony Fadell and Michael Dhuey, and design engineer Sir Jonathan Ive. Rubinstein had already discovered the Toshiba disk drive when meeting with an Apple supplier in Japan, and purchased the rights to it for Apple, and had also already worked out how the screen, battery, and other key elements would work. The aesthetic was inspired by the 1958 Braun T3 transistor radio designed by Dieter Rams, while the wheel based user interface was prompted by Bang & Olufsen's BeoCom 6000 telephone. The product (\"the Walkman of the twenty-first century\" ) was developed in less than one year and unveiled on October 23, 2001. Jobs announced it as a Mac-compatible product with a 5 GB hard drive that put \"1,000 songs in your pocket.\"\n",

At the September 9, 2009 keynote presentation at the Apple Event, Phil Schiller announced total cumulative sales of iPods exceeded 220 million. The continual decline of iPod sales since 2009 has not been a surprising trend for the Apple corporation, as Apple CFO Peter Oppenheimer explained in June 2009: \"We expect our traditional MP3 players to decline over time as we cannibalize ourselves with the iPod Touch and the iPhone.\" Since 2009, the company's iPod sales have continually decreased every financial quarter and in 2013 a new model was not introduced onto the market.\n",

      "SCORE: 0.46870225604860843, DOCUMENT: Buddhism: According to the scriptures, Gautama Buddha presented himself as a model. The Dharma offers a refuge by providing guidelines for the alleviation of suffering and the attainment of Nirvana. The Sangha is considered to provide a refuge by preserving the authentic teachings of the Buddha and providing further examples that the truth of the Buddha's teachings is attainable.\n",
      "SCORE: 0.40412745416462215, DOCUMENT: Buddhism: The Mahayana sutras are a very broad genre of Buddhist scriptures that the Mahayana Buddhist tradition holds are original teachings of the Buddha. Some adherents of Mahayana accept both the early teachings (including in this the Sarvastivada Abhidharma, which was criticized by Nagarjuna and is in fact opposed to early Buddhist thought) and the Mahayana sutras as authentic teachings of Gautama Buddha, and claim they were designed for different types of persons and different levels of spiritual understanding.\n",
      "SCORE: 0.3752309049949433, DOCUMENT: Buddhism: Formal membership varies between communities, but basic lay adherence is often defined in terms of a traditional formula in which the practitioner takes refuge in The Three Jewels: the Buddha, the Dharma (the teachings of the Buddha), and the Sangha (the Buddhist community). At the present time, the teachings of all three branches of Buddhism have spread throughout the world, and Buddhist texts are increasingly translated into local languages. While in the West Buddhism is often seen as exotic and progressive, in the East it is regarded as familiar and traditional. Buddhists in Asia are frequently well organized and well funded. In countries such as Cambodia and Bhutan, it is recognized as the state religion and receives government support. Modern influences increasingly lead to new forms of Buddhism that significantly depart from traditional beliefs and practices.\n",
      "SCORE: 0.3728594910484329, DOCUMENT: Buddhism: Buddhists believe Gautama Buddha was the first to achieve enlightenment in this Buddha era and is therefore credited with the establishment of Buddhism. A Buddha era is the stretch of history during which people remember and practice the teachings of the earliest known Buddha. This Buddha era will end when all the knowledge, evidence and teachings of Gautama Buddha have vanished. This belief therefore maintains that many Buddha eras have started and ended throughout the course of human existence.[web 15][web 16] The Gautama Buddha, therefore, is the Buddha of this era, who taught directly or indirectly to all other Buddhas in it (see types of Buddhas).\n",
      "SCORE: 0.3426225862264868, DOCUMENT: Buddhism: According to the scriptures, soon after the death of the Buddha, the first Buddhist council was held; a monk named Mahākāśyapa (Pāli: Mahākassapa) presided. The goal of the council was to record the Buddha's teachings. Upāli recited the vinaya. Ānanda, the Buddha's personal attendant, was called upon to recite the dhamma. These became the basis of the Tripitaka. However, this record was initially transmitted orally in form of chanting, and was committed to text in the last century BCE. Both the sūtras and the vinaya of every Buddhist school contain a wide variety of elements including discourses on the Dharma, commentaries on other teachings, cosmological and cosmogonical texts, stories of the Gautama Buddha's previous lives, and various other subjects.\n",
      "SCORE: 0.34061499929292605, DOCUMENT: Buddhism: Much of the material in the Canon is not specifically \"Theravadin\", but is instead the collection of teachings that this school preserved from the early, non-sectarian body of teachings. According to Peter Harvey, it contains material at odds with later Theravadin orthodoxy. He states: \"The Theravadins, then, may have added texts to the Canon for some time, but they do not appear to have tampered with what they already had from an earlier period.\"\n",

      "SCORE: 0.31700025017592554, DOCUMENT: Buddhism: According to author Michael Carrithers, while there are good reasons to doubt the traditional account, \"the outline of the life must be true: birth, maturity, renunciation, search, awakening and liberation, teaching, death.\" In writing her biography of the Buddha, Karen Armstrong noted, \"It is obviously difficult, therefore, to write a biography of the Buddha that meets modern criteria, because we have very little information that can be considered historically sound... [but] we can be reasonably confident Siddhatta Gotama did indeed exist and that his disciples preserved the memory of his life and teachings as well as they could.\"[dubious – discuss]\n",
      "SCORE: 0.3040410812506259, DOCUMENT: Buddhism: The concept of liberation (nirvāṇa)—the goal of the Buddhist path—is closely related to overcoming ignorance (avidyā), a fundamental misunderstanding or mis-perception of the nature of reality. In awakening to the true nature of the self and all phenomena one develops dispassion for the objects of clinging, and is liberated from suffering (dukkha) and the cycle of incessant rebirths (saṃsāra). To this end, the Buddha recommended viewing things as characterized by the three marks of existence.\n"
