    "#### The `Minimum Edit Distance` is defined as the minimum total cost of operations required to transform a source string of characters into a given target string. We will consider three possible operations, `insertion` of a character into source string, `deletion` of a character from source string and `substituting` a character from the source string with any charcter from the vocabulary. We will assign a cost of 1 for insertion/deletion and cost of 2 for substitution (a substitution can be thought of as a deletion followed by an insertion, also a substitution of a character with itself has zero cost).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The minimim edit distance between two strings can be computed using `dynamic programming`. Given a string `X` of length `n` and a string `Y` of length `m`, we first define `D[i,m]` as the minimum edit distance between `X[0:i]` and `Y[0:j]`, i.e. the substring containing first i characters of X and first j characters of Y (note that X[0] and Y[0] are defined as the empty string). Dynamic programming allows us to compose the solutions to these subproblems to compute the edit distance between X and Y which is given by `D[n,m]`. To use dynamic programming, we first note the base case, D[i,0] = i (this is because going from a source string containing first i characters of X to the empty string target requires i delete operations and hence cost i)  and D[0,j] = j (because going from the empty source string to the target containing first j characters of the Y requires j insert operations and hence cost j). Then we note that the following recursion relation allows us to compute all other values of D[i,j] starting from the base case:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### $D[i,j] = min(D[i-1,j] + del\\_cost(X[i]), D[i,j-1] + insert\\_cost(Y[j]), D[i-1,j-1] + substitute\\_cost(X[i],Y[j]))$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note that this equation takes the minimum of three possible paths through the D[i,j] matrix. Intuitively, consider that we know the costs D[i-1,j], D[i,j-1] and D[i-1,j-1]. Now note that if we delete the ith character (X[i]) from X[1:i] to get X[1:i-1] and then transform it to Y[1:j] which costs D[i-1,j], then the cost of transforming X[1:i] to Y[1:j] is simply the cost of D[i-1,j] plus the cost of that one delete operation. Similarly a second path would be to first transform X[1:i] to get Y[1:j-1] and then insert the jth character of Y (Y[j]) into Y[1:j-1], which has cost D[i,j-1] plus the cost of that one insertion. Finally, the third possible path is that given X[1:i], we can just transform the first (i-1) characters in X, i.e. X[1:i-1] into Y[1:j-1], then just swap the ith character (X[i]) with the jth character of Y (Y[j]), which has cost D[i-1,j-1] plus the cost of the swapping. Then the optimal cost D[i,j] is just the minimum of these three possibilities.  \n"
